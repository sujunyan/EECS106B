        You should try to use mesh.mass to get the mass of the object.  You should check the 
        output of this, because from this
        https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/trimesh/blob/master/trimesh/base.py#L2203
        it would appear that the mass is approximated using the volume of the object.  If it
        is not returning reasonable results, you can manually weight the objects and store 
        them in the dictionary at the top of the file.
